# Static Folder

This is the static folder, all assets located in this directory will be automatically moved to the `public` directory in production and made available for use on web pages etc.

All files in this folder will be served from their relative path e.g:

* `static/foo.bar` will be available at `/foo.bar`
* `static/images/images.png` will be available at `/images/images.png`
